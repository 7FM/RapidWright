### RapidWright Status Update

RapidWright will be released as an open source project in the first week of October. This beta release will have similar functionality to the previous offering and we expect the new release to be easier to use.  Lower level functionality will be provided as a library of APIs, while the majority of the code will remain open source.  We look forward to engaging with the community and appreciate your support and patience.
