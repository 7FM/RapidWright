============= RapidWright 2018.2.4-beta released on 2018-11-15 =================
Notes:
 - API Additions:
   - com.xilinx.rapidwright.design.SiteInst "public boolean unrouteIntraSiteNet(BELPin src, BELPin snk)"
   - com.xilinx.rapidwright.design.SitePinInst "public void setSiteInst(SiteInst instance, boolean keepRouting"
   - com.xilinx.rapidwright.device.Wire "public ArrayList<PIP> getBackwardPIPs()"
   - com.xilinx.rapidwright.device.Wire "public ArrayList<PIP> getForwardPIPs()"
 - API Removals:
   - com.xilinx.rapidwright.device.Wire "public ? getBackwardPIPs()"
   - com.xilinx.rapidwright.device.Wire "public ? getForwardPIPs()"
 - Resolves issues: #14, 15
Known Issues:
 - Netlists that have two ports by same name where one is a single bit
 bus and another is multi-bit are not currently supported (for
 example, a module has an input 'my_signal' and 'my_signal[2:0]' is
 currently not allowed in the EDIF parser.
 - Clock router in Router class is disabled (under development).  
 - PolynomialGenerator is a toy demonstration and does not produce a
 functionally valid circuit.
